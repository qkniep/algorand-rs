Algorsand is a Rust implementation of the Algorand blockchain,
which aims to be more performant than the original Algorand implementation in Go.
It provides not only the client/node but also tools for generating keypairs, signatures, and so on.
AFAIK it is the first implementation of Algorand apart from [go-algorand](https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand),
and for now it is basically a Rust clone thereof.

## About Algorand

Algorand is a layer-1 blockchain and is the worldâ€™s first pure proof-of-stake blockchain.
It is currently considered to be one of the possible Ethereum challengers, similar to Cardano and Solana.
Specificlaly, it focuses on improving performance (txs/sec) and environmental friendliness.

## Getting Started

```shell
cargo build
cargo tests
```

## Roadmap
- [ ] finish porting go-algorand
- [ ] setup Concourse CI or Drone.io (maybe)
- [ ] improve msgpack performance
- [ ] identify performance bottlenecks
